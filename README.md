## Overview
Help UMass Amherst students and Amherst residents feel safer by enabling their awareness of local crimes, letting them see reported crimes in the area immediately rather than waiting to hear of danger from others. They can also contribute to the communityâ€™s safety by reporting crimes themselves and notifying nearby users of the incident. Can effectively notify locals of a crime and call 911 at the same time, reducing waiting periods and confusion of those nearby. Reward those that help others and report crimes sooner to unify the community. Make it easy for authorities to know of and gain clarity on incidents.
